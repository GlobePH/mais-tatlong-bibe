IHAP is an open platform which aims to be integrated with processes and systems of agencies involved in disaster management. 

<h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
<ul>
<li> 1. IHAP provides a platform where Local Government Units (Barangay Development Council) can quickly create and submit reports.
•	IHAP provides a form where responsible unit can input the data that highly matters to the NDRRMC’s command center:
	Fatalities
	Injuries
	Missing
	Hospitalized
	Evacuated
	Sheltered </li>
<li> 2. IHAP provides the command center with summarized data which helps in making decisions.  
•	An SMS message containing a summary from the LGU to the command center through Globe Labs SMS API. 

•	The submitted data is then converted to charts in a web application accessed by the command center. It will be the basis for a suggested supplies distribution plan and manpower deployment.
•	The data update is also available in the app for the end users.</li>
<li>3. To easily validate the submitted reports, IHAP allows the general public to submit disaster photos or videos.
•	The photo and video submissions allow the NDRRMC command center to verify the authenticity of the reports submitted by the LGUs by capturing the real scenario that numbers cannot convey.</li>
<li>4. IHAP also provides a monitoring of evacuation centers around the country.
•	IHAP allows the authorized agency to submit and update evacuee count after the disaster. This way, proper relief activity will be executed. </li>
<li>5. Moreover, IHAP provides a real time monitoring of rescue and relief responses deployed by the command center. 
•	IHAP allows a transparent and efficient disaster response by giving the general public access to operations’ status.</li>
<li>6. Other features:
•	IHAP allows a transparent and efficient disaster response by giving the general public access to operations’ status.
•	An announcement feature is also included in the IHAP. It provides information to end users based on feeds from reliable sources (i.e. DOST, Pagasa, Phivolcs etc.)</li>
