IHAP is an open platform which aims to be integrated with processes and systems of agencies involved in disaster management. 

<h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>

<h4>1. IHAP provides a platform where Local Government Units (Barangay Development Council) can quickly create and submit reports.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
IHAP provides a form where responsible unit can input the data that highly matters to the NDRRMC’s command center:
	Fatalities
	Injuries
	Missing
	Hospitalized
	Evacuated
	Sheltered</li></ul>
<h4>2. IHAP provides the command center with summarized data which helps in making decisions.  </h4>
<ul><li>An SMS message containing a summary from the LGU to the command center through Globe Labs SMS API. </li>

<li>The submitted data is then converted to charts in a web application accessed by the command center. It will be the basis for a suggested supplies distribution plan and manpower deployment.</li>
<li>The data update is also available in the app for the end users.</li></ul>
<h4>3. To easily validate the submitted reports, IHAP allows the general public to submit disaster photos or videos.</h4>
<ul><li>The photo and video submissions allow the NDRRMC command center to verify the authenticity of the reports submitted by the LGUs by capturing the real scenario that numbers cannot convey.</li></ul>
<h4>4. IHAP also provides a monitoring of evacuation centers around the country.</h4>
<ul><li>IHAP allows the authorized agency to submit and update evacuee count after the disaster. This way, proper relief activity will be executed. </li></ul>
<h4>5. Moreover, IHAP provides a real time monitoring of rescue and relief responses deployed by the command center.</h4> 
<ul><li>IHAP allows a transparent and efficient disaster response by giving the general public access to operations’ status.</li></ul>
<h4>6. Other features:</h4>
<ul><li>IHAP allows a transparent and efficient disaster response by giving the general public access to operations’ status.</li>
<li>An announcement feature is also included in the IHAP. It provides information to end users based on feeds from reliable sources (i.e. DOST, Pagasa, Phivolcs etc.)</li></ul>
